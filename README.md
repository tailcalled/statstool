# statstool
A tool for doing statistics for psychology.

Currently it expects all the response options to start with a number coding their value, e.g. "-2: Disagree strongly" or "1: Agree", so it is unlikely to be useful on data that is not of this format. It also only works on csv files. I might include more detailed tutorials if I make the tool more broadly useful.
